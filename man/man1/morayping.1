.SH NAME
.PP
morayping \- check if a Moray server is functioning
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
\fB\fCmorayping [COMMON_OPTIONS] [\-dF]\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Attempts to determine whether Moray is functioning.  For this command, success
indicates that Moray is functioning and able to respond to a request.  Failure
indicates the command could not successfully connect and complete a request.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\fC\-d\fR
Attempt to determine whether Moray has a working connection to its
underlying data store by making a "deep" ping request instead of a trivial
request.
.TP
\fB\fC\-F\fR
Block until at least one Moray server is found and a connection is
established, then execute the ping request.  This is intended to
programmatically wait for Moray to become available, although if the request
fails (e.g., because of a network issue), the request is not retried, and in
this case Moray may still be down.
